To view the contents of a Dockerfile, you can use several commands. Here are a few options:

Using cat:
   cat /root/webapp-color/Dockerfile

Using less:
   less /root/webapp-color/Dockerfile

Using more:
   more /root/webapp-color/Dockerfile

Using vi or vim:
   vi /root/webapp-color/Dockerfile

Using grep to find specific lines (e.g., the base image):
   grep -i FROM /root/webapp-color/Dockerfile

These commands will help you inspect the Dockerfile to find the base image or any other details you need. Let me know if you need further assistance! ðŸ˜Š

***************************************************************************************************

To read a Dockerfile, you can use several commands in the terminal. Here are a few options:

cat: This command will display the entire content of the Dockerfile.
   cat Dockerfile

less: This allows you to scroll through the file content.
   less Dockerfile

more: Similar to less, but with slightly different navigation.
   more Dockerfile

vi or nano: These are text editors that allow you to view and edit the file.
   vi Dockerfile

or

   nano Dockerfile

grep: If you're looking for a specific line, like ENTRYPOINT, you can use:
   grep ENTRYPOINT Dockerfile

Since you're working on a task related to the webapp-color directory, make sure you're in the correct directory where the Dockerfile is located before running these commands. If you need to navigate to the directory, you can use:

cd /path/to/webapp-color

Let me know if you need further assistance! 
***************************************************************************************************
Move to the directory first by using the cd command and verify the path of the working directory from pwd command :-

$ cd /root/webapp-color/
$ pwd
/root/webapp-color
Now, run the docker build command within that directory :-

$ docker build -t webapp-color . 
NOTE: At the end of the command, we used the "." (dot) symbol which indicates for the current directory, so you need to run this command from within the directory that has the Dockerfile.

***************************************************************************************************
To run a Docker container from an image, you can use the docker run command. Here's a basic example of how you can do this:

docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]

For your specific task, you need to run an instance of the image webapp-color and map port 8080 on the container to port 8282 on the host. You can achieve this with the following command:

docker run -p 8282:8080 webapp-color

Here's a breakdown of the command:

docker run: This is the command to start a new container.
-p 8282:8080: This option maps port 8080 inside the container to port 8282 on your host machine.
webapp-color: This is the name of the image you want to run.
Make sure you have the webapp-color image available locally. If not, Docker will try to pull it from a Docker registry.
